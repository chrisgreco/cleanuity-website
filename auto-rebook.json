  "question": "How does the auto-rebook feature work?",
  "answer": "Our auto-rebook feature allows you to schedule recurring cleanings with your favorite cleaner. When you book a cleaning, simply check the 'Auto-Rebook' option and select your preferred frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). After each cleaning, you'll receive a notification with a one-click confirmation button for your next scheduled cleaning. You can modify or cancel your auto-rebook schedule at any time through your account settings."
