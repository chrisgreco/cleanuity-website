  "question": "How does the smart home integration work?",
  "answer": "Cleanuity integrates with popular smart home systems like Amazon Key and SmartThings to provide secure, keyless entry for your cleaners. During the booking process, select the 'Smart Home Integration' option and choose your system. You'll be guided through a secure setup process that grants temporary access only during your scheduled cleaning window. Our system automatically revokes access once the cleaning is complete, ensuring the security of your home."
