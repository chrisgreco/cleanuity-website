  "question": "How does the photo verification work?",
  "answer": "After completing a cleaning, your cleaner will take photos of key areas in your home to document the completed work. These photos are securely uploaded to your account and sent to you via email or text notification. You can review these photos to verify the quality of the cleaning, which is especially valuable for remote homeowners or Airbnb hosts who may not be present during the cleaning. All photos are stored securely and only accessible to you and your assigned cleaner."
