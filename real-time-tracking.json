  "question": "How does the real-time tracking work?",
  "answer": "When your cleaner is en route to your home, you'll receive a notification with a link to track their arrival in real-time. Similar to food delivery apps like Uber Eats, you'll be able to see your cleaner's location on a map and get an accurate ETA. This feature eliminates the uncertainty of waiting and allows you to plan your day more effectively. You'll also receive status updates as your cleaner arrives, begins cleaning, and completes the service."
